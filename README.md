<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p align="center"><i>It is built using Flutter and Google map APIs. I used packages from <code>pub.dev</code>.</i>
  
<br>
 You can find the details about the packages in pubspec.yml and details of APIs in androidManifest.
  
<br>
  It's for learning so bear with the hard codes 😐.
</p>

## Details 🚀
1. Render your real time location. (Added some hard coded markers.)  🚀
2. Each card has it's respective longitude and latitude associated with it (you can find it in main.dart).

## Required Improvements ✅➕
1. When someone tap on the card below I want to create a route to that location (longitude, latitude).
2. Need to render real time position of the user when the user moves through that route (like Google maps). 
3. You're welcome to modify the UI.
